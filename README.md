# Rewilding Mathematics website - beta

This repository contains the source code for the **beta** version of the [Rewilding Mathematics website](https://jmarshrossney.github.io/rewilding-mathematics-beta).

## Contributing

These instructions are for individuals who participated in the Rewilding Mathematics seminar/workshop series.

In each case, create or edit the relevant markdown (`.qmd`) file(s) using any text editor, then do one of the following:

- Post them in the *website* channel in the *Rewilding Mathematics* Discord server
- Submit a pull request to merge the additions to the `main` branch
- If neither of these options work for you, you can email me directly


### Adding or updating your profile on the 'people' page

If you do not already have a profile, copy the [template file](https://github.com/jmarshrossney/rewilding-mathematics-beta/blob/main/people/_template.qmd) and name it in the format `Firstname_Surname.qmd`.

To do - explain how to add an image from either an existing location on the internet, or by referencing an image in the `assets/` directory.

### Add a blog post

To do.

### Add a news item

This is exactly the same deal as with the blog post, but the contents should be placed in the `news/` directory as opposed to the `posts/` directory.


## Building the website locally

The only thing you need to build this website locally is [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
In the root of the cloned repository, run `quarto preview` to render and preview the site.
With a few exceptions, any changes you make to the source files (`.qmd`) will be immediately reflected in the website preview.
See [further instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#website-preview) on previewing Quarto websites.


## Queries

If you are on the *Rewilding Mathematics* Discord server, feel free to ask any questions on the *website* channel.
